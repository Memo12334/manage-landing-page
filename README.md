# Manage Landing Page

This repository contains my solution to the "Manage Landing Page" challenge from Frontend Mentor. The challenge involved creating a responsive landing page for a project management application called "Manage."

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to build a landing page that closely resembles the design provided by Frontend Mentor. The design includes various sections such as a hero banner, features section, pricing plans, testimonials, and a contact form. It's not responsive for tablets.
